#b)	Comment to explain the code and algorithm 
#c)	Prompt the user for their full name (first and last name).
#d)	Prompt the user with greeting followed with their full name. 
#e)	Ask the user to enter number of credit requires for graduation
#f)	Elective courses
#g)	Compulsory courses
#h)	Specific subject required for graduation
#i)	Language test requirement
#j)	40 hours community service

#Note: The program must loop for 3 times to accommodate other users.
